Succinct structures are compressed data structures designed to represent data in a space-efficient manner while allowing basic operations such as search, 
insertion, deletion, and navigation on the original data. These structures are characterized by taking up very little space compared to the uncompressed 
representation of the same data.

Succinct structures are valuable in environments where space savings are critical, such as in managing large data sets or in memory-constrained systems. 
These structures take advantage of efficient compression and representation techniques to achieve a good relationship between the space occupied and the 
ability to perform operations on the data.

Some examples of succinct structures include succinct trees, succinct arrays, and succinct graphs, among others. Each of these structures is designed to 
represent and manipulate different types of data in a space-efficient manner.
