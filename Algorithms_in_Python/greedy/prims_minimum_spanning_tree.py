# Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm

"""
Prim’s algorithm is also based on a greedy approach to find the minimum cost spanning tree. Prim’s algorithm is very similar 
to the Dijkstra algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. In this algorithm, we start with an arbitrary node as a 
starting point, and then we check the outgoing edges from the selected nodes and traverse through the edge that has the lowest 
cost (or weights). The terms cost and weight are used interchangeably in this algorithm. So, after starting from the selected node,
we grow the tree by selecting the edges, one by one, that have the lowest weight and do not form a cycle. The algorithm works as follows:

- 1. Create a dictionary that holds all the edges and their weights
- 2. Get the edges, one by one, that have the lowest cost from the dictionary and grow the tree in such a way that the cycle is not formed
- 3. Repeat step 2 until all the vertices are visited
