A suffix array is a data structure that stores all the suffixes of a given string in a specific order. A string suffix is
â€‹simply a substring that starts somewhere in the original string and extends to the end of the string.

The main purpose of a suffix array is to facilitate quick search for common substrings between different strings, as well 
as perform efficient queries on the original string.

For example, if we had the string "banana", a suffix array of this string would contain the following suffixes in order:

["banana", "anana", "nana", "ana", "na", "a"]

This type of data structure is widely used in string search algorithms and in applications that require frequently querying 
the substrings of a given string.

The suffix array has a wide range of use cases in different fields. Some of them are:

1. Common substring search: It can be used to find the longest common substrings between two or more strings. This is useful
in bioinformatics, natural language processing, and other areas where text sequences are compared and analyzed.

2. Efficient pattern search: Allows efficient searches for a pattern within a string. For example, in algorithms such as the
Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) substring search algorithm or the Boyer-Moore substring search algorithm.

3. Text analysis: It can be used to analyze large amounts of text, such as in search engines, spell checking programs, text
similarity analysis, etc.

4. Data Compression: Storing the suffixes of a string can help in data compression, as repetitive patterns within the original
string can be identified and stored efficiently.

These are just a few examples of the many use cases in which a suffix array can be used to improve the efficiency and speed of
different algorithms and applications.
