# Frontend Concepts

## 1- Internet
The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols. It is a global network of interconnected routers, which are responsible for directing traffic between different devices and systems.

#### Hosting
Web hosting is an online service that allows you to publish your website files onto the internet. So, anyone who has access to the internet has access to your website

#### Browsers
A web browser is a software application that enables a user to access and display web pages or other online content through its graphical user interface

## 2- HTML 
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used on the frontend and gives the structure to the webpage.

#### Semantic HTML
Semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. In HTML, semantic element are the type of elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page.

## 3- CSS
CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is the language used to style the frontend of any website. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

#### Modern CSS
The way we write CSS in our modern front-end applications is completely different from how we used to write CSS before. There are methods such as Styled Components, CSS Modules, Styled JSX, Emotion, etc

## 4- JavaScript
JavaScript allows you to add interactivity to your pages.

## 5- Package managers
Package managers allow you to manage the dependencies (external code written by you or someone else) that your project needs to work correctly.

## 6- Libraries and Framework
#### Library 
A software library is a collection of pre-written code that developers can reuse in their own programs. Imagine it as a toolbox filled with specialized tools â€“ each one performs a specific task, saving developers time and effort.

####  Framework
Web frameworks are designed to write web applications. Frameworks are collections of libraries that aid in the development of a software product or website. Frameworks for web application development are collections of various tools. Frameworks vary in their capabilities and functions, depending on the tasks set. They define the structure, establish the rules, and provide the development tools required.

#### Libraries vs Framework
- **Libraries are like tools**
They help you solve specific problems within your code.

- **Frameworks are like blueprints**
They dictate the structure and flow of your entire application.
